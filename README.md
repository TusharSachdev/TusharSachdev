# 👋 Hi, I'm Tushar Sachdev

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

As a **Statistical Programmer and Data Analyst** and I transform complex business data into actionable insights that drive strategic decision-making. With a strong foundation in **probability theory**, **applied statistics**, and **modern machine learning**, I currently work at **[Spopli.com](https://spopli.com)** in Dhule, Maharashtra, where I help the business forecast performance, understand customer behavior, and optimize internal operations.

My work is deeply rooted in **data storytelling** — blending rigorous analysis with compelling visualizations to communicate findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [Client GAP & ROI Analysis with Odoo ERP](https://github.com/your-repo)
- Analyzed over 50 projects across departments to understand ROI distribution, delay patterns, and client satisfaction.
- Built **ARIMA models** to forecast future ROI trends.
- Developed **Bayesian regression** to quantify uncertainty in ROI predictions.
- Performed **client clustering** to identify loyal, delayed, and high-value segments.

### 🔹 [Bayesian & Regularized Regression Analysis](https://github.com/your-repo)
- Modeled ROI using **Bayesian regression (PyMC)** with posterior predictive checks and uncertainty intervals.
- Compared results with **OLS and Ridge/Lasso regression** using `scikit-learn`.

### 🔹 [Client Segmentation using Clustering](https://github.com/your-repo)
- Implemented **KMeans clustering** based on delay, satisfaction, and ROI metrics.
- Visualized clusters to identify client segments for marketing and retention strategies.

## 🎯 What Drives Me

I’m driven by the power of **statistical thinking** and **data intuition**. My goal is to:

- 📈 **Help businesses make better decisions** using data
- 🧪 **Bridge theory and application** through robust modeling
- 🗺️ **Explore patterns** in complex datasets
- 🤝 **Collaborate across departments** to solve real-world problems with data

Whether I’m designing a forecast model, building a Bayesian simulation, or visualizing trends in client satisfaction, I strive to deliver **clarity from complexity**.
