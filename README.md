# 👋 Hi, I'm Tushar Sachdev

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a **Data Science and Statistical Analyst** passionate about transforming raw data into **actionable business intelligence**. Currently, I work with [**Spopli Technologies**](https://spopli.com): a Digital Transformation and Odoo ERP Services company, where I help bridge the gap between **data, decisions, and strategy**.

### 🔍 What Makes My Work Valuable:
With a strong foundation in **probability theory**, **applied statistics**, and **modern ML**, I create reusable, data-driven frameworks that help Spopli and its clients:
- Audit and clean ERP data before it causes financial/reporting issues.
- Optimize workflows by automating support, forecasting project overruns, and predicting client risk.
- Drive business decisions with measurable ROI and GAP insights.
- Enhance stakeholder communication using compelling data visualizations and clear storytelling.
