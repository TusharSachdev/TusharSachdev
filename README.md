# 👋 Hi, I'm Tushar Sachdev

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a **Statistical Programmer & Data Analyst** with a strong foundation in scientific research and a growing specialization in applied statistics, machine learning, and business analytics. I currently work at **[Spopli.com](https://spopli.com)** in Dhule, Maharashtra, where I lead data-driven projects focused on **traffic forecasting**, **customer churn prediction**, and **stakeholder-oriented reporting**.

## 🔍 What I Do

- 📈 **Website Traffic Forecasting**  
  Built models to forecast website traffic using historical logs and time series analysis to improve resource planning and campaign timing.

- 🔁 **Customer Churn Prediction**  
  Developed predictive models to identify high-risk customers using statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and behavioral data — directly aiding retention strategy.

- 📊 **Dashboarding & Reporting**  
  Created interactive dashboards using **Tableau** and **Python** to deliver insights to non-technical stakeholders, enabling data-informed business decisions.

- 🤝 **Stakeholder Collaboration**  
  Regularly translate complex model outputs into actionable insights for cross-functional teams — aligning data work with company strategy.
